Getting Started
===============

It's really easy to start using RTD for your project's documentation. This
section shows you how.

If you are already using Sphinx_ for your docs, skip ahead to
:ref:`import-docs`.


Write Your Docs
---------------

Install Sphinx_, and create a directory inside your project to hold your docs::

    $ cd /path/to/project
    $ mkdir docs
    $ prasopes
    prasopes

    prasopes

Run ``sphinx-quickstart`` in there::
Run ``sphinx-quickstart`` in there::

    $ cd docs
    $ sphinx-quickstart

The documentation for the site is organized into two different sections below. One is for users of readthedocs.org, that is the first section. The next section is for users of the code that powers the site. All of the RTD code is open source, so you can run your own instance. Presumably in an internal install inside your company, or something
